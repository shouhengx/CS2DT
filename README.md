# CS2DT
This is the code of the hyperspectral image classification network: CS2DT: Cross Spatial–Spectral Dense Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification (CS2DT). The datasets required for the code can be found at http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes or http://dase.grss-ieee.org/.

Now we have shown the backbone of the code, the details of which will be published after the paper CS2DT: Cross Spatial–Spectral Dense Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification  is accepted.
